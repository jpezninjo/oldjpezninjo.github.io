<h2>Computer Science Portfolio</h2>
<hr />
<p>My name is Joseph Perez, I am a <del>second</del> third year Computer Science major curently attending the <a href="http.usfca.edu/">University of San Francisco</a> with an expected graduation of Spring 2017. This page is where I shall keep an updated list of classes and noteworthy projects and concepts learned and used by myself throughout my beginning CS years.</p>
<p><br /> I am presently simultateously working on creating a working, playable program featuring the game of Network.</p>

<h2>2012-2014 High School</h2>
<p><strong>Java Programming Honors</strong></p>
<p>This was my first exposure to programming. I took an elective that exposed students to programming using the Java language. For developemnt we used the NetBeans IDE and wrote basic programs that taught us fundamentals such as variables, methods, console input and output, basic manipulation and calculations using variables, and most importantly syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Minecraft ComputerCraft + Modded programing</strong></p>
<p>In 2012, ComputerCraft was growing in popularity due to its inclusion in popular MC modpack distributors such as Tekkit and FeedTheBeast. ComputerCraft sought to bring the concept of programming within Minecraft into reality. <a href="http://computercraftedu.com/">ComputerCraftEdu</a> is a spin-off by the original creator partnered with Google to teach younger kids how to code using Minecraft as a compelling persuasive environment.</p>
<p><strong>Yearbook</strong></p>
<p>I was a memeber of yearbook for my last 3 years. I was fond of shooting pictures at school events, particularly home football games and our annual homecoming rally. My specialy was writing copies (page summaries) and rearranging pictures on our pages to balance out reader attention. I learned how to sharpen and correct images through Adobe photoshop. In my senior year I acted mainly as supervisor and mentor to learn underclassmen.</p>
<p><strong>Newspaper</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately my first year on newspaper staff was our last year for our faculty advisor. I served as a layout editor and assisted our head layout editor in compiling our writer's segments onto our newspaper. Our real work came from having to juggle both articles and entire sections of newspaper (such as Sports or Social News) around to make each page fit as much text as possible.</p>

<h2>2014-2015 Freshman Undergrad</h2>
<p><strong>Introduction to Computer Science I</strong></p>
<p>This is the first class that Computer Science majors are expected to take at USF. Students are taught the basics of programming in general using the Python language. We are also taught to become familiar with developing within a Linux OS development/terminal</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Computer Science II</strong></p>
<p>This is the second class taken by CS majors at USF. Here we are taught Object-Oriented Programming design patterns and Java syntax. My professor, <a>Alark Joshi</a> specialized in Graphical User Interfaces and would often alow students to turn our projects/labs into GUI's for extra credit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphical User Interfaces</li>

<h2>2015-2016 Sophomore Undergrad</h2>
<p><strong>Software Development</strong></p>
<p>In this class students are expected to complete a software project over the course of one academic semester, broken up into 5 smaller projects. For my section, taught by <a>Sophi Engle</a>, our overall project was a search engine featuring web search capabilities and data-base keeping/building/searching. Additionaly, we learned about the fundamentals of multi-threaded programming, the basics of creating and modiying data using Structured Query Language (SQL)</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Complex regexes</li>
<li>Basic SQL commands</li>
<li>Multi-threading and thread-safety</li>
<li>Design of complex software</li>
<li>Version Control</li>
<li>Search Engine</li>
<ul>
<li>Back end</li>
<ul>
<li>Over the course of a semester I worked on a complex search engine designed to scan and analyze files and webpages for word entries * and store them in an inverted index structure that kept track of word location and frequencies of each word. When parsing webpage code, this project stripped out all HTML code but saved nested, valid links (including fragments and #*) to be parsed as well</li>
</ul>
<li>Front end</li>
<ul>
<li>I also added abilities for my search engine to be deployable to local host and be usable from a standard web browser, prompting for web addresses to scan and displaying an index of words found from that provided link</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parallel Programming</strong></p>
<p>? For this class I became familiar with writing parallelized programs using either MPI or PThreads. I had three large scale projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic C and pointers</li>
<li>Message Passing Information (MPI), PThreads, CUDA/GPUs</li>
<li>Accessing from RAM vs from Cache</li>
<li>Dijstra's Algorithm</li>
<li>Bitonic Sort</li>
<li>Conway's Game of Life</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Movie Recommender</li>
<li>Huffman Encoding</li>
<ul>
<li>File compressing</li>
<li>Huffman Trees</li>
</ul>
<li>Persistant Data Types</li>
<ul>
<li>Binary Search Trees</li>
<li>Stack</li>
</ul>
<li>Dijkstra's Algorithm</li>
<ul>
<li>Hashing</li>
<li>Adjacency Lists/Matrixes</li>
<li>Binomial Queue</li>
</ul>
<li>Network The Game</li>
<ul>
<li>Board game-like design</li>
<li>Computer Player AI</li>
</ul>
<li>Algorithm Time-Space complexity</li>
<li>Spanning Trees/Minimal Cost Trees</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linear Algebra and Probabilty</strong></p>
<p>Most noteworthy about this class was my professor's, <a>Vincent Mtasko</a> interest in creating geometric art with different algorithms. Because</p>
<ul>
<li>LaTex Docs</li>
<li>Sage.math Fractal project</li>
<li>Processing 3 Fractal-based movie scences</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flash Animations</strong></p>
